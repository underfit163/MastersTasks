# MastersTasks
Solving tasks for admission to the magistracy.

Tasks:
1) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements under the secondary and main diagonal of an integer square matrix (including the adjacent elements of the diagonals).
2) Find the maximum element in the array of real numbers.
3) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements over the secondary and main diagonal of an integer square matrix (including adjacent elements of the diagonals).
4) Find the product of positive elements in an array of real numbers.
5) Find the number of the last occurrence of a given (by value) element in an array of real numbers.
6) Find the product of odd-valued elements in an array of integers.
7) Count the number of occurrences of a given element in an array of real numbers.
8) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements to the right of the secondary and main diagonal of an integer square matrix.
9) Find the number of the minimum element in an array of real numbers.
10) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements over the secondary and main diagonal of an integer square matrix.
11) Find the number of the first occurrence of a given (by value) element in an array of real numbers.
12) Find the product of even-valued elements in an array of integers.
13) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements of the side diagonal of an integer square matrix.
14) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements of the main diagonal of an integer square matrix.
15) Find the number of the maximum element in an array of real numbers.
16) Find the product of negative elements in an array of real numbers.
17) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements to the left of the secondary and main diagonal of a square integer matrix.
18) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements to the left of the secondary and main diagonal of an integer square matrix (including adjacent elements of the diagonals).
19) Find the arithmetic mean of an array of integers.
20) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements to the right of the secondary and main diagonal of a square integer matrix (including adjacent elements of the diagonals).
21) Find the arithmetic mean of all elements under the secondary and main diagonal of an integer square matrix.
22) Find the minimum element in an array of real numbers.
23) Find the arithmetic mean of a square matrix of integers.
24) Find the index of the beginning of the longest continuous sequence of identical numbers in an integer array.
25) Find the index of the beginning of the shortest (at least two) and contiguous sequence of identical numbers in an integer array.
26) Sort an array of integers in ascending (descending) order.
27) Find the median in an array of real numbers. To calculate the median, the array should be sorted in ascending order and, in the case of an odd number of members, take the middle element, and in the case of an even number of members, take the arithmetic mean between the two “middle” members.
28) Find the trace of an integer square matrix (the sum of the elements of the main diagonal).
29) Find the transposed matrix.
